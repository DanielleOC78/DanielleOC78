<!--Iâ€™m an educator, visual designer, and art director from Flagstaff, AZ. Iâ€™m originally from Germany, but moved to the US to pursue a degree in Visual Communication. My professional expertise lies in branding, packaging, and event design. Recently, Iâ€™ve become interested in learning more about UI/UX design, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing an MS in Graphic Information Technology at ASU. I'm new to coding, but I'm excited to learn more about the technical side of digital design. 

In my free time, I enjoy spending time outdoors with my husband, 3 kids, and our dog. I love snowboarding, mountain biking, rock climbing, and camping.-->
